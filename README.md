# Garlic Bread Poetry

##How
    
    At the moment, this is taking in a large body of text, consisting of 2 garlic bread recipies. 
    
    Using the text analysis module that I built earlier, it strips the text down to sentences with a set structure, and chooses a random structure, then populating it with the relevent type of word; noun/verb/adjective ect.
    
    The output is then put through the poemify module, so it looks a bit more ~*poetic*~
    
    This method means that most of the outputs dont neccersarily make much sense, and it runs extremely slowly.

##Plans for the future

    
- Using markov chains for sentence generation
- Validation that it is a valid sentence? 
- Punctuation
- Speed optimisation
