# Garlic Bread Poetry


    
   At the moment, this is taking in a large body of text, consisting of a couple of garlic bread recipes. 
   
   There is functionality to retweet and favorite tweets, but thats commented out at the moment.
    
   Using the text analysis module that I built earlier, it strips the text down to sentences with a set structure, and chooses a random structure, then populating it with the relevent type of word; noun/verb/adjective ect.
    
   The output is then put through the poemify module, so it looks a bit more *poetic*
    
   This method means that most of the outputs dont necessarily make much sense, and it runs extremely slowly.

**Plans for the future**

    
- Validation that it is a valid sentence? 
- Punctuation
- Speed optimisation
